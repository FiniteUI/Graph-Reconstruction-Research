# Graph-Reconstruction-Research, Fall 2017
This is part of my Fall 2017 Undergraduate Research project, attempting to progress towards proving or disproving the Graph Reconstruction Conjecture.

This project was supervised by Dr. Ken W. Smith. Roughly 20 students participated in this research, working as a full group once a week and working more closely in smaller groups of 3-5 meeting once a week. However, most of the students were Mathematics students, and I was the most experienced Computer Science student and programmer. 

Final Report.pdf is a complete walkthrough of all of my group's work over the semester, and includes brief explanations of the subject matter.

## A  Quick Explanation Graph Reconstruction Conjecture:
The GRC is an unproven conjecture in Graph Theory about simple graphs. For a simple graph, a **card** is a graph generated by taking the original graph and removing one specific vertex and all edges that connect to that vertex. The **deck** of a graph is the set of all its cards, that is, the set of cards where each card was generated by deleting a different vertex from the original graph. The GRC states simply that a graph can be reconstructed using only its deck, with no knowledge of the original graph (including no knowledge of the original vertex labels). While this is certainly true of some simple graphs (for example, any graph with a bridge, an single edge connecting two different sections of a graph, is very easy to reconstruct), it has yet to be proven or disproven for all simple graphs. However, it is generally thought to be true.

During this project we mostly worked with **Kocay Graphs**, which are generated by taking a graph of degree n (meaning each vertex is connected to n other vertices) and removing one edge from it. If k is the number of vertices, a Kocay graph has k-2 vertices of degree n, and 2 vertices of degree n, and 2 vertices of degree n-1. Kocay graphs are known to be relatively hard to reconstruct.

Specifically, this project was interested in Kocay graphs generated from cubic graphs on 10 vertices. A list of these 19 cubic graphs on 10 vertices can be found in Graph-Reconstruction-Research/Data/Cubic graphs with 10 vertices.pdf

While we did not expect to find a counterexample in these graphs because the GRC has been proven for graphs on 0 - 11 vertices, we were looking for specific types of graphs and observations that when expanded to larger graphs might contain a countereample.

The easiest way to disprove the Graph Reconstruction Conjecture would be to find two seperate graphs that produce the same deck. We looked at these possibilities by examing Kocay graphs which shared a subset of their deck, and examining partial automorphisms among the Kocay graphs. A partial automorphism, simply put, is the graph version of a partial function. In short, it doesn't directly map from x to y, but it almost does. Partial automorphisms and why they were important to this project are explained in Graph-Reconstruction-Research/Data/2_PartialAutomorphisms.pdf

For those interested in the subject matter, the folder Further Reading contains Kocay's original paper on the subject, which sets the grounds for all of our work, an explanation of Partial Automorphisms by Dr. Smith, and an explanation of the method we used to generate interesting graphs towards the end of the project.
